    <section><h4>Early Life</h4></section>
    <p>
        I grew up in DeKalb, Illinois, where I spent most of my childhood. During my early adolescence, I was heavily
        into video games—titles like <i>Call of Duty</i>, <i>Minecraft</i>, and <i>Grand Theft Auto</i> were some of my favorites. When I
        wasn’t gaming, I enjoyed going outside to play sports with friends, especially when others weren’t online.
        As I got older, my interests began to shift more toward sports, particularly as I formed new friendships. I
        started playing football in eighth grade and continued through my sophomore year of high school. Around that
        time, I realized I wasn’t growing much taller, so I decided to shift my focus more toward academics.

    <section><h4>Working With Me</h4></section>
    <p>
        I’m generally an outgoing person and value face-to-face interactions. I believe you can learn a great deal
        about someone through their body language and facial expressions. While I might be a bit shy or quiet in a new
        environment, I adapt quickly once the ice is broken. Building healthy relationships with coworkers is important
        to me, especially since we spend so much time together. I believe strong team chemistry is essential to
        producing quality work, no matter the size of the project. I also recognize the importance of clear
        communication—both listening and speaking effectively are key to collaboration.
    </p>
    <section><h4>Legacy & Inspiration</h4></section>
    <p>
        I’m the oldest of six grandchildren in my immediate family, which comes with a great deal of pressure to set a
        positive example for the others. Rather than letting that pressure weigh me down, I embraced it—and it’s one of
        the reasons I’m proud to be a first-generation college graduate. I want to show my siblings and cousins that
        they too can overcome the challenges life throws at them. The person who has motivated me the most to reach my
        potential is my father. As a single parent, he has never stopped providing for my two siblings and me. He never
        hesitates to inconvenience himself for the sake of others. I’ve seen my father at some of his lowest points,
        yet he has always come back stronger. If I can grow to be even half the man he is, I’ll consider that
        a life well lived.
