    <p>
        During my senior year at Aurora University, I participated in a required capstone course focused on designing
        and building a full-stack application while learning new technologies. My team developed a mobile app aimed at
        helping students manage their personal assignments, finances, and weekly schedules. We built the application
        using React Native, C#, the .NET Framework, and DynamoDB.
        My primary contributions included developing the majority of the backend, specifically implementing CRUD
        operations and managing database interactions. I also worked on several front-end components, including screens
        that display user-specific information. You can find the GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/gthompson06/capstone-project">here</a>
