    <section><h4>DoubleTree by Hilton – Downer's Grove, IL</h4></section>
    <p>
        During the summer of 2018, I worked at DoubleTree by Hilton to save up for my first car. My position was known
        as a houseman, where I was responsible for setting up and cleaning event spaces for weddings, meetings,
        banquets, and other gatherings hosted by the hotel. Working in teams of 2 to 4, we followed detailed
        instructions to ensure each room was arranged exactly to the organizer’s specifications.

    <p>
        I am currently employed at Portillo’s in Batavia, Illinois, where I’ve been working since May 2021.
        Portillo’s is a high-volume restaurant where teamwork and communication are essential. When a station slows
        down, team members are expected to support one another to keep operations running smoothly. Over time, I’ve
        built strong relationships with my coworkers, often spending time with them outside of work. The hard work I’ve
        put into the company hasn’t gone unnoticed—I was offered a lower-level managerial position. However, I chose to
        decline the offer in order to keep my full focus on my education.
