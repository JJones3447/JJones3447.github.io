    <p>
        I am a proud graduate of the Class of 2020 from DeKalb High School, where I spent all four years of my high
        school education. I earned a GPA of 3.943, placing me among the top 40 students in my graduating class.

    <p>
        After high school, I attended online courses at Eastern Gateway Community College from 2020 to 2022, where I
        earned an Associate of Arts degree with a 4.0 GPA. I completed the program with the intention of transferring
        to a university to continue my education.

    <section><h4>Aurora University</h4></section>
    <p>
        When I transferred to Aurora University in the fall of 2022, I was still undecided about my major. I met with
        a counselor to explore different classes and fields that might interest me. He suggested I take a programming
        course to see if computer science might be a good fit, as it's a rapidly growing field. After completing that
        class, I knew that computer science was the path I wanted to pursue. In May 2025, I achieved a lifelong dream
        by becoming the first member of my family to graduate from college.
